Node-RED Oracle Database nodes
====================================


`node-red-contrib-oracledb-2` is a [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/packaging.html) package that connects directly to an Oracle database server. It currently contains a query and a configuration node to connect to Oracle databases for Node-RED storage.

It uses the [oracledb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oracledb) library for the Oracle database connectivity.

## Installation     <a name="installation"></a>

If you have installed Node-RED as a global node.js package (you use the command `node-red` anywhere to start it), you need to install
node-red-contrib-oracledb-2 as a global package as well:

```
$[sudo] npm install -g node-red-contrib-oracledb-2
```

If you have installed the .zip or cloned your own copy of Node-RED from github, you can install it as a normal npm package inside the Node-RED project directory:

```
<path/to/node-red>$ npm install node-red-contrib-oracledb-2
```

## Overview     <a name="overview"></a>

This is a Node-Red Oracle database input/output node. The function it provides depends on the query that is sent to the oracle database. An INSERT query stores data in the database and a SELECT query can send data to another node.

## Roadmap     <a name="roadmap"></a>

The roadmap section describes things that I want to add or change in the (hopefully near) future.

### Planned
- Improve documentation
- Make testable
- Add localization

### Realized
- Make it an input and output node:
  - Add support to return SELECT query results

## Developing     <a name="developing"></a>
This project is now using Typescript source and Gulp to transpile from src to lib.  The lib folder is still version controlled, but SHOULD NOT be used as source!

### Build
`gulp build`

### Publish
`npm publish`
